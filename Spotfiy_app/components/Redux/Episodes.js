      'Do you have a colleague who’s a nosy busybody that always gets you in trouble with your boss? Have you ever felt like a black sheep at work? Have you ever experienced a hard time trying to explain your ideas but no one has a clue what you’re saying? Moreover, do you have a colleague that takes advantage of you and always brown noses the boss? And what makes things even worse is that the boss is a slave driver and loves to order around. On top of that, the COVID-19 lockdown thing is really hard to swallow. Suddenly, all hell has broken loose. Now, all that you’re thinking about is what you can do to vent your frustration. All you want to do is back out, pack up, and leave everything behind. You just want to sit with one of your close friends and start screaming until you’re blue in the face. They’ll probably try to get through to you by asking you to calm down and take a deep breath. I would say that they’ll recommend that you own up to your feelings and try to deal with them so you could eventually become a top banana one day.',

      "Here I am, in the evening, laying down on my bed, my hands are under my head, and my eyes are closed. All I can think about was my next game in Mans, France. My head was in the clouds. I’ve been dreaming about this day since I was 6 years old. I've always wanted to be an auto racer and participate in the FIA World Championship (Formula one). Out of nowhere, I received a text message from my team member that my game has been canceled until further notice. I flipped out (or freaked out). What a bummer! He was such a buzzkill. I didn’t get what was going on. What was happening? I didn’t believe him. It was such a bitter pill to swallow. I tried to get along with him just to catch on to what he was trying to tell me. For one moment, I thought what was reported to him was hearsay just because some of my competitors want to knock me down.  Who knows? When did we ever hear of a total lockdown across Europe? And because of what? A virus? After all the hardship I’ve been through this year, the FIA Championship being called off was the last straw. It was a once in a blue moon event. This really sucked!",
